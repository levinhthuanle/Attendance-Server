## üöÄ 1. System Overview



### A. Infrastructure & Technology



- **API Backend**: RESTful FastAPI service with JWT/OAuth2 authentication.

- **Database**: Relational schema with key tables:

&nbsp; - `Users` (students, teachers)

&nbsp; - `Classes`, `Sessions` (individual lectures)

&nbsp; - `AttendanceRecords`, `Configs`

- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**:

&nbsp; - Peripheral mode for teachers (advertising)

&nbsp; - Central mode for students (scanning)

&nbsp; - Unique UUIDs for session identification

- **Security**:

&nbsp; - Role-based access control (RBAC)

&nbsp; - Encrypted transmission (TLS for API, AES for BLE payloads)

&nbsp; - Runtime permission handling (Bluetooth, Location)
